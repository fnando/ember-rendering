1. There are some branches available. Choose one to try it out! Your best bet is `master`, which runs Ember 1.9.10 (HTMLBars) and has a React.js example.
2. After switching to that branch, run `bower install`.
3. After installing dependencies, you can run a local server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9999` or `php -S localhost:9999`.
4. Go to <http://localhost:9999>.
5. Always reload the page after rendering the results to have a clean state.
